          "description": "In late 2016, the URA, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2016 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for the City of Pittsburgh. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.",

Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that over 339 million individuals grapple with asthma, a chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. The prevalence of asthma varies across regions and is influenced by factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and socio-economic conditions. In some developed nations, urbanization and increased exposure to allergens contribute to higher rates of asthma. Moreover, disparities in healthcare access and quality can impact the prevalence and management of asthma, with vulnerable populations often facing greater challenges. Efforts to address asthma prevalence involve public health initiatives, education, and research aimed at understanding the multifaceted factors influencing the condition, ultimately contributing to better prevention and management strategies.",

This vaccine has been an integral part of routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the incidence and severity of chickenpox. Administered typically in two doses, the varicella vaccine not only provides direct protection against chickenpox but also contributes to the prevention of more severe complications and the potential reactivation of the virus as shingles later in life. By stimulating the immune system to recognize and combat the varicella-zoster virus, the vaccine plays a pivotal role in public health efforts to control the spread of this contagious disease, promoting a healthier and safer community.",

          "description": "In late 2016, the URA, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2016 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for the City of Pittsburgh. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.",

Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that over 339 million individuals grapple with asthma, a chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. The prevalence of asthma varies across regions and is influenced by factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and socio-economic conditions. In some developed nations, urbanization and increased exposure to allergens contribute to higher rates of asthma. Moreover, disparities in healthcare access and quality can impact the prevalence and management of asthma, with vulnerable populations often facing greater challenges. Efforts to address asthma prevalence involve public health initiatives, education, and research aimed at understanding the multifaceted factors influencing the condition, ultimately contributing to better prevention and management strategies.",

This vaccine has been an integral part of routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the incidence and severity of chickenpox. Administered typically in two doses, the varicella vaccine not only provides direct protection against chickenpox but also contributes to the prevention of more severe complications and the potential reactivation of the virus as shingles later in life. By stimulating the immune system to recognize and combat the varicella-zoster virus, the vaccine plays a pivotal role in public health efforts to control the spread of this contagious disease, promoting a healthier and safer community.",

In January 2012, the United States experienced a lingering aftermath of the housing market collapse that began in 2008, as reflected in the national foreclosure statistics. During this period, foreclosure rates remained elevated, and a considerable number of properties were repossessed by lenders. The statistics painted a sobering picture of the challenges faced by American households, highlighting the continued ripple effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.",

Method of calculation: Since 1 April 1968, calculated from the daily morning fixing; From January 1950 to 21 March 1954, calculated using the Bank of England's gold purchasing price (1 ounce of fine = pound 12.40) in connection with the average exchange rate for the pound in New York (up to the end of 1952; source: Federal Reserve Bulletin) and, from January 1953, midpoint exchange rates for the US dollar in London (source: Financial Times (FT)). From 22 March 1954 to December 1959, calculated using the fixing price for gold bars of approx. 12 1/2 kg and 995/1000 fineness and over (so-called standard bars) according to data from Metallgesellschaft AG, Frankfurt am Main, in connection with the average midpoint exchange rates for the US dollar in London (source: FT). From January 1960 to 14 March 1968, average fixing price for standard bars as specified in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin. On 15 March 1968, fixing price suspended.
